The LazyInitializedSingleton class should only allow one instance of 
the class to be created.

The getInstance() method should be synchronized to ensure that only one 
instance of the class is created even if multiple threads attempt to create it simultaneously.

The SingletonThread class should print the hashcode of the singleton 
instance obtained from the getInstance() method along with the ID of the thread.

The Main class should create three SingletonThread objects and start them, 
which should demonstrate that only one instance of the singleton is created and shared among the threads.

The hashcode may be different, but it should be the same for all three threads, 
indicating that only one instance of the singleton is being shared among the threads. 
If the output shows different hashcode, then the implementation may not be correct 
and further debugging may be necessary.
